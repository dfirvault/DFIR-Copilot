# DFIR-Copilot
A Splunk app that brings local, offline LLM-powered analysis directly to your DFIR and threat hunting workflows. DFIR Copilot uses Ollama to run models like Mistral or Llama3 locally, enabling you to ask complex questions about your Splunk search results without ever sending data to the cloud.
